# Habit Tracker - Blue Lock Inspired

This is a personal project inspired by the aesthetics and energy of Blue Lock. The app is minimal by design and focuses on what matters most: building habits that truly count.

## Philosophy

I don’t know if anyone else will use this, but I built it for myself. The app once completed, will allow you to track up to 6 habits.

**Why only 6?**
I believe that if I can complete six meaningful habits in a day, I’ve won that day.

In the future, I plan to introduce different “areas” so users can switch between sets of habits depending on context (e.g., “Mind,” “Body,” “Work”).

## Status

This project is for fun. I have no idea what I am doing but I will leave no regret and learn as much as I can.
